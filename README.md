This is a tool that tells you what to dismantle in Super Snail. Good for putting together rocket parts!

* Open up [blob/master/main.py](main.py)
* Copy all the code
* Go to your favorite Python REPL ([this one is fine](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/))
* Paste the code in
* Look at the top of the code to configure it
* Delete the # in front of the applicable `resource_names`
* Fill in `current_resources` in the same pattern as is shown in the garage's Material list (it's the spherical thing on the left of the bench)
* Fill out `required_resources` based on what you're trying to build
* Hit the Run button

It'll spit out the order to dismantle things, assuming a solution exists.
